"""TTS adapters. Two engines behind one interface, chosen by TTS_ENGINE.

`edge` (EdgeTts) is the working default: Microsoft's neural Tamil voices, no
API key, no model download, and it runs on CPU - which is what makes a voice
demo possible on this hardware at all. ta-IN-PallaviNeural is female.

PRIVACY - read before pointing this at real callers. edge sends the text to be
spoken to a Microsoft endpoint. That is fine for local testing with the
fictional Aruvi data in golden/, and NOT fine for real patient speech: this is
a hospital agent and the text is PHI-adjacent (see BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec4,
which already flags exactly this gap). For deployment use a self-hosted engine
- AI4Bharat Indic Parler-TTS is the recommended first try (SETUP.md) - behind
the same interface, and the rest of the pipeline does not change.

`svara` (SvaraTts) is the original placeholder, kept because it is what
BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.2 specifies; its load() still raises until a real
svara-TTS reference exists.

Both keep asr.py's load()/ready shape - loaded once at startup (see main.py's
lifespan) so per-call synthesis never pays model-load latency - and both return
mono int16 PCM at the engine's native rate. Resampling stays out of these
adapters so one code path serves a 16 kHz browser socket today and an 8 kHz SIP
leg later without knowing which it is talking to.

Original module docstring follows.

svara-TTS streaming adapter (voice-cloned, sentence-chunked synthesis).

Mirrors asr.py's load()/ready shape: the model and cloned-voice reference are
meant to be loaded once at startup (see main.py's lifespan) so per-call
synthesis never pays model-load latency. Output stays at the model's native
sample rate - BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.2 keeps resampling out of this
adapter so the same code path can serve a 16 kHz browser socket today and an
8 kHz SIP leg later without knowing which transport it's talking to.

load() is a placeholder: no real svara-TTS package/API reference exists yet.
synthesize()'s call into self._model assumes a plausible shape (text in,
float32 waveform in [-1, 1] out, at whatever rate self._model reports) so the
rest of this class - and main.py's wiring - is real and testable now; that
assumed shape is the only thing likely to need adjusting once the real
package lands.

# The Tamil neural voice SILENTLY DROPS the English half of such a token.
